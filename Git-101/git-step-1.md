Step 1: Intro to version control systems
----------------------------------------

Whether you come from a coding background or not, chances are, you have run into the need for a Version Control System (VCS). Ever had any of these questions?

-   How do I make incremental changes and share my work with others?
-   How do I go back to the version of this file from (yesterday, last week, last year, ...)?
-   What changed between version X and version Y of a file?
-   People have been making changes to the same file (or set of files)... How do I reconcile and merge all these changes?

If you have ever asked yourself any of these questions, you have a need for a Version Control System.

Version Control Systems address problems like those described above and others that you probably haven't thought of yet (and we aren't including here). They are powerful tools that help you share files, track changes, and manage changes and contributions from authors and contributors.

A number of Version Control Systems are available today ([Git],
[Mercurial], [Subversion], and others...). For our purposes, which are:

1.  Getting you a copy of the sample we are going to work with
2.  Getting you started with a basic VCS workflow

We are going to use the Git Version Control System and GitHub as our central code repository.

Git vs. GitHub
--------------

**Git** is an open source ([git-scm.com][Git]) Distributed Version Control System, while **GitHub** is a commercial company that runs the
[GitHub.com] repository, based on Git VCS tech.

Git is the underlying VCS technology and utility that is tracking changes and providing the tools to work with the files under "version control."  

GitHub is the cloud service we have chosen to host our sample code repository. 

GitHub enables content authors and contributors with both a place to host their version controlled files and powerful collaboration tools that support the content development and maintenance processes. 

GitHub also enables sharing and distribution of your version controlled files including mechanisms and tools for formal release versioning, content documentation and even static web hosting for your project.
